I started out knowing next to nothing about coding. Now I'm learning how to leverage the power of software to build things to help people and make the world a better place.

Hi, my name is Jonathan Chua. In June of 2015, I was a total noob to programing. I had a little experience with HTML and CSS, but that is all I knew about "code." Since then I've dabbled in JavaScript, Ruby, and Swift. My latest project was building this blog using [Jekyll][jekyll].

Software is an amazing thing. With a keyboard and mouse, you can create things that have the power educate, entertain, and even change lives. Working with code is a multifaceted blend of art and engineering that can take you from the depths of despair to the heights of triumph in a matter of seconds when you finally find that single, simple mistake in your code that broke everything.

Follow me as I explore the world of programing. I'll share what I'm doing and what I'm learning. I hope you'll join me on this adventure!

Thanks for reading!
